<b>Shell:</b> 
Changing the volume slider icon to match the GTK3 one doesn't seem to be possible. The darker/all black variant has been scrapped. The assets that are being used to replicate the GTK3 elements are PNG files, this is perfectly fine unless someone wants to alter them. SVG files would be preferred but I cannot into making gradients in Inkscape.
