This is a roadmap file and also a simple where to get started guide for anyone that wants to help out with Minwaita. If you want to be a collaborator just let me know and be precise about what changes you've made in your pull requests.

<h1>Todo</h1>

<b>GTK2:</b>
The checkbox and radio buttons assets closer resemble their GTK3 counterparts but they're not identical. Gradients still need to be made for that to happen. Inkscape wizards are free to apply.

<b>GTK3:</b> 
Nothing right now, really.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Shell:</b> 
The end goal is to make the Shell version look identical to the GTK3 version. How do we give the buttons gradients? What about the volume control slider icon? How do we make that identical to the GTK3 version's? In both cases I'm guessing either a background-image or border-image rule will work.
A "darker" variant is also being worked on. Assets need to be recolored to match the new colour scheme and someone will have to do a quick runthrough of the theme and decide which parts need recolouring.
