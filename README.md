# Minwaita
Reduces excessive padding from the default GNOME, Adwaita to make it more compact. Some of the additional tweaks include: 

<ul>
<li>Window shadow being reduced to get rid of the "dirty" look Adwaita has.</li>
<li>New window buttons.</li>
<li>The appmenu icon in the topbar has been removed (with spacing accounted for)</li>
<li>The spacing in third-party indicators and the aggregate menu have been tweaked to make it all appear uniform</li>
<li>Additional Dash to Dock styling to make the dock feel more "complete"</li>
<li>A couple more tasteful design tweaks such as removing the progressbar borders all for a cleaner look</li>
</ul>

The end goal is to provide a sleaker, more streamlined GNOME experience without the need for too many extensions and additional tools.
