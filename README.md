# Minwaita
A tweaked, more compact version of the default GNOME theme, Adwaita. Some of the additional tweaks include: 

<ul>
<b>GTK2/3</b>
<li>Window shadow being reduced to get rid of the "dirty" look Adwaita has.</li>
<li>New headerbar styling</li>
<li>GTK2 assets more resemble their GTK3 counterparts</li>
<li>New window button options - OSX, Vertex and regular/no custom buttons</li>
<li>A couple more tasteful design tweaks such as removing the progressbar borders for a cleaner look</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>Shell</b>
<li>There is now a light variant</li>
<li>The appmenu icon in the topbar has been removed (with spacing accounted for)</li>
<li>Dropdown arrows have been removed</li>
<li>Colours, the panel, buttons and entry fields closer resemble elements found in the GTK3 theme</li>
<li>The spacing in third-party indicators and the aggregate menu have been tweaked to make it all appear uniform</li>
<li>Additional Dash to Dock styling to make the dock feel more "complete" and resemble Plank</li>
</ul>

The end goal is to provide a sleeker, more streamlined GNOME experience without the need for too many extensions and additional tools.
