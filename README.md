# Minwaita
Reduces excessive padding from the default GNOME, Adwaita to make it more compact. Some of the additional tweaks include: 

<ul>
<li>Window shadow being reduced to get rid of the "dirty" look it would make windows have</li>
<li>Window buttons from the Vertex theme have been imported for a (divisely) cooler look</li>
<li>The appmenu icon in the topbar is hidden with spacing accounted for</li>
<li>Spacing between third-party indicators and the aggregate menu have been tweaked to make it all appear uniform</li>
<li>Dash to Dock dock shrinkage rules have been imported to make the dock smaller</li>
<li>Additional Dash to Dock styling to make the dock feel more "complete"</li>
<li>A couple more tasteful design tweaks such as removing the progressbar borders all for a cleaner look</li>
</ul>

The end goal is to provide a sleaker, more streamlined GNOME experience without the need for too many extensions and additional tools.
